# Computational-Optics
This repository contains PDF files of the codes I developed while taking the Computational Optics Laboratory course at IIT Delhi. The codes introduce fundamental concepts used in computational imaging and are intended to help beginners explore key ideas in optics through practical implementation.

While these codes are not perfect and may contain minor errors, I plan to correct and refine them using Python notebooks in the future.

The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal reference â€“ a way for me to revisit and refresh my understanding of the topics covered in the course. At the same time, I hope it can be a useful resource for students and beginners interested in computational optics, providing them with hands-on examples that complement theoretical learning.
